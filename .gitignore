#    Welcome to the Rodent Society SwizzKnife .gitignore file. This file is crafted to serve as a       #
#    versatile tool, adaptable to a wide range of projects. It's designed to efficiently manage what    #
#    gets tracked in version control by providing a broad spectrum of predefined sections tailored to   #
#    various needs within the development environment.                                                  #
#                                                                                                       #
#    We've structured this file to come with essential sections enabled by default, ensuring the        #
#    security of your repositories and maintaining a clean project environment. These active sections   #
#    include settings to ignore sensitive credentials, operating system-generated files, and            #
#    temporary or miscellaneous files typically unnecessary in version control.                         #
#                                                                                                       #
#    Some sections are initially disabled to allow for customization based on your specific project     #
#    needs. These include language-specific configurations and IDE settings. This flexible setup        #
#    empowers you to activate or deactivate sections as your development tools and languages demand.    #
#                                                                                                       #
#    We recommend maintaining the default enabled settings to safeguard sensitive data and prevent      #
#    clutter. However, you're encouraged to modify these settings by commenting or uncommenting         #
#    entries to align with your projectâ€™s unique requirements.                                          #
